       7- Create a new resource file and name it recyclerview_mail_item.xml, in this file you are
       going to add views that later will appear in each row inside Android Recyclerview.

       8- First view that you are going to add inside recyclerview_mail_item.xml is the email
       sender icon which is not actually an icon! Itâ€™s just an Android Textview with a circle
       drawable as a background which appear like an actual icon :]

       9- Create a new file under drawable folder and name it rounded_drawable.xml,
        inside this file you will add an Android shape which is oval with a background color.

        next: 10- Open up recyclerview_mail_item.xml file and add an Android TextView that
         will represent the email sender icon. In this TextView you will use the rounded
         drawable as the background and you will need to adjust the layout width and height
          that so that it will look great next to the other views.-->
